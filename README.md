installing the latest Docker-CE releases, Docker Compose releases, and Conjur on the supported linux
distros. It is not recommended to deploy Conjur Open Source
to production systems. For more thorough instructions for installing
on the supported distros, see the [install
instructions](https://conjur.org).
